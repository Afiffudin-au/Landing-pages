# Landing-pages
hi everyone! this is a landing page project built using bootstrap framework and it's very responsive. You can fork this repo or you can download it directly. When I have free time, I'll be working on a landing page project, and I'll post it on Github publicly and free.

## Note
Most of my projects are of the private type, but for now and so on I will make my projects public freely.
